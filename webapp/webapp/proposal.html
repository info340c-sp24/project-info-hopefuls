            <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
            <p>Nowadays a lot of apps that are marketed as fitness pal apps have paywalls that make it impossible for users to use the app for its intended use.
                Newcomers and veteran gym-goers most likely already pay for gym memberships and would like to avoid buying other memberships, especially with
                something as simple as a gym tracker. A lot of these apps also have too many features, making it confusing to use. Apps like <cite><a href="https://www.strong.app/"></a>“Strong Workout Tracker Gym Log”</cite> 
                are loaded with features that are helpful for newcomers but people with more experience would like to simply have a place to plan and log in their workouts in a simple manner.
                Though many apps do provide ways to plan and log, they often <cite><a href="https://www.ready4s.com/blog/7-things-people-hate-in-fitness-apps"></a>don’t give users exactly what they need</cite>. They include calorie tracking, premade workout videos, 
                generic questions about your goals, meal planning, body measurement trackers, etc. This is overwhelming information and for a lot of veteran gym goers, it turns obsolete. 
                So what are the features that would get the most interactions? What if there was a web app that simply had those most used features? Most fitness apps have preset workouts for 
                their users, this is ineffective because workouts should be customized to each person and their needs. Creating your own workouts should be a key feature and being able to have a fully 
                customizable set of workouts for each user is the most effective way to make sure users have their OWN workouts at their disposal to revisit, share, and post. Nothing sucks more than 
                buying an app membership and being stuck with generic workouts that you can't change. Being able to create your own workouts, plan a week out based on your customized workouts, create 
                your own catalog of workouts that work for YOU, and share those with friends and other users is the sole purpose of a workout planner. There is no need for gimmicks that you 
                barely use or workouts that aren't giving you the results you need.
